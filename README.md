# Expense-Tracker
This is an expense tracking app that will allow the user to track their expenses and see how much they are spending and saving each month. 

The tracker uses a CLI (command line interface) as front end, Python for the backend, and a csv file for tracking data. 

This readme will be updated as the app is developed and tools, libraries, etc. become solidified.
